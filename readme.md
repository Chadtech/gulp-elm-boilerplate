# HI THERE

This is my 

# Elm Gulp Browserify Boilerplate

Its basically a template development environment with my favorite tooling and what I believe to be the best practices. It also might be useful to look at, if you are learning how to use Elm.

How to get going..
```
> git clone https://github.com/Chadtech/gulp-elm-boilerplate.git new-project
> cd new-project
> npm install
> elm package install --yes
> gulp

then open up http://localhost:2960
```
