# Gulp - Elm Boilerplate

In this repo, there is a gulp file, that compiles main.elm to public/elm.js, and servers public/index.html to localhost:2999. This repo provides a development environment for Elm projects using Gulp.

To get started, enter into your terminal..

```
npm install
gulp

```

If you decide to adopt this repo for your elm development, I suggest npm-installing a CSS compiler like stylus or sass, both of these are available as gulp plugins.
